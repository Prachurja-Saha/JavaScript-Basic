// Node.Js is JavaScript run time enviornment

// Javascript add functionality in web page (make dynamic)

// History
// in old days different browser have there own javascript code i.e Netscape, internet explorer
// etc.
// developer writing different javascript code for the different browser
// so thats why Ecma Internation company comes into this picture, they defines the standardize
// javascript code and every company has to follow them

// The term EcmaScript and JavaScript are often used interchangeably
// EcmaScript is standardization of JavScript programming language
// JavaScript is implementation of EcmaScript Specification

// Standard Always updated i.e ES1, ES2.., ES13

/// IMP -> Different browser have their own JavaScript engine, so every one's  javaScript
///        implementation is different, because of that some browser are using latest version
///        of EcmaScript and some are using older. we can check which browser using which 
///        version by using this website -> caniuse.com
